This is a story about taking control of one's life. The story is about a romantic biologist and a driven sorcerer who is obsessed with a video game programmer. 
It takes place in a bustling port city. Magic is increasing in power, and that plays an important role in the story.

A romantic biologist takes a stroll to the outskirts of the city. Not necessarily for pleasure, but for study. The biologist finds a good assortment of flowers and plants of all kinds, and becomes infatuated. But all of a sudden, they begin to mutate. The biologist, shocked with terror, knows that there was only one appropriate thing to do here: take three photos. And because she valued her life, she also ran away afterwards. But the mutated plants chase her, using their leaves or vines as legs, and almost catch her.

Out of the blue, she sees the town’s sorcerer floating in on a platform of yellow haze. The sky darkens and the clouds grow thick and dense. The biologist doesn’t look back as she weaves through the tall grass. Missing her footing as she hops over a fallen branch, she trips and lies victim to the mutant plants. At the perfect time, the sorcerer casts a shield over her and calls down thunder upon the mutant plants. The mutants lay motionless and the romantic biologist is saved. 	

The biologist stands up and thanks the sorcerer for his bravery. As the biologist is talking the sorcerer notices a cute but mischievous programmer scanning the dead mutants.  The sorcerer, intrigued by the programmer approaches him and asks, “what are you doing mate?”  the programmer answers in an arrogant way, “I am having a milkshake “mate.”” The biologist peaks into the reading the programmer was getting and says, “wow the PH levels are off the charts.” The sorcerer uses a scan spell on the biologist, programmer, and plants. The sorcerer askes the group “do you guys know what is going on guys?” This is not from my realm of expertise. Why are you scanning all of the plants?” he asked the software developer admiring his wits and scanning around for more mutant plants.

Sorcerers smell something wrong about the programmer since his behavior is different to sorcerer and biologist. The conversation between sorcerer and programmer had arguments also the way programmer had arrogantly replied to sorcerer. Sorcerer  gets jealous because the biologist gives a compliment to the programmer silently without others knowing. Sorcerer worries that the biologist is blind because he trusts the programmer without knowing the intention of the programmer’s idea. But the biologist complimented him for the fake action did before. Sorcerers watch from hidden places to see what biologists compliment programmers.  Sorcerer gets mad at one point of time because he feels that it is not safe until knowing the complete intention of the programmer. Sorcerers  throw fireballs at the biologist to break the conversation between them. Once the programmer left, the sorcerer revealed the truth and suspected a biologist about the programmer. They decided to observe the programmer's behavior.
 
Much to the programmer’s dismay, the biologist and the sorcerer follow the programmer to his headquarters, where he will report his findings. “So… is this kinda like your job?” asks the sorcerer. “Yes,” says the programmer. “Due to the increase in the power of magical energy, they’ve been sending me to scout magical readings in various areas.” The biologist then slyly compliments the programmer. But before she can properly finish her interaction, her leg is jolted by the sorcerer. With a maniacal smirk, the biologist continues to spark conversation with the nervous programmer.

The programmer goes on “it seems a new kind of magical energy has recently entered our atmosphere”, the sorcerer nudges his way between the two as they huddle around the programmer’s monitors. “And whatever this energy is made out of is causing the plants to mutate'' says the programmer, “Oh my! Let me take a look at what you've scanned and we can dissect the formula causing these mutations'' says the biologist. When the programmer heard this he immediately shut his screen and backed away, “I don't need any help, you guys need to get out of here!” 

Biologists try to dissect the formula created by the programmer, but the programmer gets into madness, so he kicks the biologist and sorcerer out of his research space. Still sorcerers use his knowledge of spelling and analytic the environment. Sorcerer is already obsessed with the programmer; he realizes something that the programmer misses using the magical energy. Sorcerers call programmers out for conversation about the hidden information regarding the formula that he creates. Programmer opens up about that formula gas using dead mutants which have already scanned and processed, he created and has been released into the atmosphere. 

The army of mutant plants around the city start to fall to the ground dead motionless. The programmer, happy about the results, starts to thank the sorcerer and biologist for the help. When they hear  a loud boooom!! Radiating from the center of the city. The sorcerer concerned rapidly chants a spell and a yellow cloud forms. “Quickly the sorcerer says get on the cloud lets go check it out” the sorcerer says.” The programmer replies, “ Who do you think you are doctor fate?” as he gets on the cloud. As they glide to the center of the city they notice that all of the plants are dead. “ Well all the plants are dead the programmer says.”  When they get to the center they notice that the trees have started moving. “Oh no the antidote actually made trees mutate now, you made it worse what was in that formula” the biologist says. The sorcerer chants a spell and roars of thunder start to originate from the clouds. Boom, Pow, Wam lightning rains from the sky and strikes the trees. The smoke clears and they notice that it had no effect. One of the trees picks up a giant rock and launches one at the cloud striking the group from the sky. The sorcerer fights the trees but they are too many and get overwhelmed. One of the trees raps his roots around the sorcerer's feet and grounds him. The other one swings and strikes him on the head, killing him instantly. The biologist screams “noooooo!!!!” and the programmer runs and covers the biologist's mouth. When a tree hears them and  starts to chase after them. They try to run as fast as they can, but trees come from everywhere catching up to them and killing them on the spot. Trees now walk the earth with no humans around.
