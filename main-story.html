This is a story about taking control of one's life. The story is about a romantic biologist and a driven sorcerer who is obsessed with a video game programmer. 
It takes place in a bustling port city. Magic is increasing in power, and that plays an important role in the story.


A romantic biologist takes a stroll to the outskirts of the city. Not necessarily for pleasure, but for study. The biologist finds a good assortment of flowers and plants of
all kinds, and becomes infatuated. But all of a sudden, they begin to mutate. The biologist, shocked with terror, knows that there was only one appropriate thing to do here: take
three photos. And because she valued her life, she also ran away afterwards. But the mutated plants chase her, using their leaves or vines as legs, and almost catch her.

The biologist stands up and thanks the sorcerer for his bravery. As the biologist is talking, the sorcerer notices a cute but mischievous programmer scanning the dead mutants. 
The sorcerer, intrigued by the programmer approaches him and asks, “what are you doing mate?”  the programmer answers in an arrogant way, “I am having a milk shake “mate.”” 
The biologist peaks into the reading the programmer was getting and says, “wow the PH levels are of the charts.” The sorcerer uses a scan spell on the biologist, programmer,
and plants. The sorcerer askes the group “do you guys know what going on guys?” This is not from my realm of expertise. Why are you scanning all of the plants?” he asked the
software developer admiring his wits and scanning around for more mutant plants.
